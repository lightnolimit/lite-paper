### Code Contributions

1. **Small fixes** (typos, small bugs): Open a PR directly
2. **Large changes**: Open an issue first to discuss the change
3. **New features**: Discuss in an issue before implementation

## Style Guidelines

Please refer to our [Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md) for detailed coding standards. Key points:

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Write meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep components small and focused

## Development Tips

### Working with Three.js Backgrounds

When modifying background effects:

- Test performance on lower-end devices
- Ensure reduced motion preferences are respected
- Keep animations smooth (60 FPS target)

### Adding New Documentation

1. Add your markdown files to `app/docs/content/`
2. Update `app/data/documentation.ts` with the new structure
3. Test navigation and search functionality

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy load heavy components
- Optimize images before adding them
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Test with Lighthouse for performance metrics
