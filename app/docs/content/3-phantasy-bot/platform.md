# Character Creation
On the [okiya.fun](https://okiya.fun) platform, players will be able to create their own AI Companions in our **Character Creation Studio** or by importing a custom model to suit their own personal tastes and preferences. 

## TRAINING ARC (BONDING CURVE)
During the training arc, creators have 24 hours to raise funds for their AI agent token.

## GRADUATION ERA (GRADUATION)

### Fees
Upon graduation, a 5 SOL fee will be taken, with 80% of it being used to fund the infrastructure costs for hosting an AI companion. From there, users can connect 

to create autonomous AI Agent tokens that will go on a journey to maturity and independence.
