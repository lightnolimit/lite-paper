## What is Alkahest?
Alkahest is the software powering.

In classical alchemy, the [Alkahest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkahest) is a universal solvent able to dissolve any other substance. Though alchemists have never been able to prove the existence of the Alkahest, we believe that it may not be a classical substance but a digital one.

The complete public rollout of the platform is TBD and is currently being battle-tested by our AI agents. However, top $VIRTUAL and $RALLY holders can also test out the platform with us.

## What is the purpose?
Currently, Alkahest is used to empower AI Agent Companions created by Phantasy, such as Alchemist and Rally.

After we rollout the Banshee platform ("Chaturbate for AI V-Tubers"), users will be able to create their own AI Agent Companions that are being "live-streamed" 24/7 and empowered with our endpoints.
