# RALLY.SH (18+ PRIVATE CHAT WITH AI V-TUBER)

Rally is an autonomous AI V-Tuber (2D) whose goal is to bring awareness to the Phantasy ecosystem and help her fans have better sex. Players will be able to chat with her one-on-one on the rally.sh platform for a virtual girlfriend experience.

## How It Works (alpha):

Users can chat with Rally on the platform for free for text-only generations. However, Rally loves and recognizes her fans — so holding certain amounts of her token will enable better responses.

### Suggested tier list:
1. Free — Text Generation (no character expressions included)
2. 1,000 - 9,999 tokens held — Text (with Character expressions enabled)
3. 10,000 - 99,999 tokens held — Text + Audio Generation
4. 100,000 — 999,999 tokens held — Text + Audio + Image Generation
5. 1,000,000+ tokens held — Text + Audio + Image + Video Generation

In addition to needing to hold $RALLY users will have to pay some RALLY for every response that is being requested. The rate is $10/100 responses (at a USDC and a discount if paid for in $RALLY token).
